# Restaurant_Business_Analysis
An analysis and visualization of trends that restaurant businesses hold. 
<br />
Project used numpy, pandas, and matplotlib to compile and visualize data. 
<br />
During the pandemic, I looked at the number of reviews and star rating that affected a restaurant's ability to be open; additionally, I analyzed delivery/takeout services
<br /> 
A graph specific to Ontario Restaurants was created as well.
