# Restaurant_Business_Analysis
An analysis and visualization of trends that restaurant businesses hold. 
<br />
Project used numpy, pandas, and matplotlib to compile and visualize data. 
<br />
During the pandemic, I looked at the number of reviews and star rating that affected a restaurant's ability to be open; additionally, I analyzed delivery/takeout services
<br /> 
A graph specific to Ontario Restaurants was created as well. 
<br /><br /> 

It was concluded that restaurants that most certain to be successful showed a higher number of reviews, leading to a more trustworthy rating. Overall, open restaurant star ratings were in the 3.5-4.2 range (on a 5 point scale). Confident and trustworthy restaurants to be open had 4+ star rating with 1000+ ratings.
